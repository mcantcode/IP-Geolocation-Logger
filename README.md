## üåê IP Geolocation Logger
An open-source Luau script, developed by @mcantcode from Discord, logs geolocation data using an [IP geolocation API](https://ipapi.co/) and sends it to a [Discord Webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) through a Roblox executor.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure the script using the following code:
```lua
getgenv().Webhook_URL = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL"
```

## üìù Notes
1. This script doesn't support any actions that violate [Roblox's Terms of Service](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use).
2. It's made for educational purposes, showing how to collect geolocation data from an IP address.
3. The script runs only on a Roblox executor that fully supports [UNC (Unified Naming Convention)](https://github.com/unified-naming-convention/NamingStandard).
